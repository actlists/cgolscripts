# Golly to LLS

This is a script I use for creating LLS pattern files.
Comes with a rule file and the python script.

lls_pattern.py: Main script
lls_pattern_grid.py: Alternate script for separate phases
lls_pattern.rule: Rulefile (not to be confused with lls_pattern.ruel)
lls_pattern.ruel: Nutshell file for custom rules (https://github.com/supposedly/nutshell/tree/master)
phases.py: Helper script for lls_pattern_grid.py

## Tutorial

0. Change the path of the script to where LLS is located. 
1. Make a selection of your pattern (Be sure to add extra padding just in case)
2. Run phases.py if you are using lls_pattern_grid.py (OPTIONAL)
3. Run the script and follow instructions from there.
